# London-Underground-Journey-Planner

This is an offline-friendly journey planner for the London Underground. Using an adjacency list linked with a List of available stations, Journeys can be planned with step by step route information, location information using Google Maps API and departure information using TFL's API. By changing the datasets stored as CSV files, this application can scale easily as the TFL network expands.
